I'm an autodidact, scientist, and programmer, probably in that order.

* I started self-learning programming in secondary school, making [a shoddy Zork tribute](https://cold-crisp-catnap.neocities.org) and [breaking webgames](https://gist.github.com/nathanielbd)

* Self-learning allowed me to excel in NAQT Quiz Bowl, but [not compared to a Jeopardy champion](https://www.naqt.com/stats/tournament/team.jsp?team_id=146925)

* It did allow me to add [breadth to my academic background](https://nathanielbd.github.io/resume.pdf) with classes in computational chemistry, quantum mechanics, and biochemistry

* My research interests include genetic interaction networks, reversible computing, and computational materials science

### What I'm doing now

* Studying mathematics and computer science at the University of Minnesota

* Mining relevant insights from genomic data in the [CSBIO Lab](http://csbio.cs.umn.edu/)

* Teaming up at hackathons such as [Hacktech](https://github.com/nathanielbd/neurolens)

* Writing interesting posts on [my blog](https://nathanielbd.github.io)

* Teaching and leading projects in STEM topics to [aspiring Asian American scientists and engineers](https://saseumn.org/) and flask/React/React Native to [app development enthusiasts](https://ADC-UMN.github.io)

* Trying to beat [Cardinal Quest 2](http://cardinalquest2.com/) 100%
